            "        \"description\": \"Once again ready to push the boundaries of their genre, Nashville based indie alt-rock band Moon Taxi is back with their sixth full length album, Set Yourself Free. With tracks ranging from rock to synth to pop to bluegrass, the new lineup showcases what 15 years as a band gets you: a polished, classic sound without fear of exploration. The five-member group- vocalist/guitarist Trevor Terndrup, lead guitarist Spencer Thomson, bassist Tommy Putnam, keyboardist Wes Bailey, and drummer Tyler Ritter- stepped back into their roots to create an album primarily written and recorded by themselves and set for release on their own label, 12th South Records.“It was really rewarding for each of us. The last record had quite a few co-writes- this record did not. We challenged ourselves to write most of the material on our own and that’s really something to hang your hat on these days when you typically hire an outside writer or producer,” said Bailey on the band’s creative process. “We really tried to look inward and do a lot of that on our own.” Remote collaboration on Set Yourself Free started for the group during the pandemic, but 15 years of working together made that transition a smooth one.“During the pandemic, we got used to FaceTime songwriting. For better or worse, it’s been a great way for everyone to collaborate remotely. The lyics for the title track, Set Yourself Free, were even written on a 5 way call. And the song shows that collaborative color throughout. The idea of falling back on someone you trust is so important nowadays. But truly it’s how we’ve tried to operate as a band for all these years.” said Terndrup.“You know, we’ve been a band for a while and we know each other really well. We spend a whole lot of time together, so it’s not that foreign to be able to get on a call and get your point across to anybody else in the band. We know each other well enough to be able to accomplish that,” added Putnam.The album was finished through work in a few Nashville studios with the help of producer and collaborator, Brennan Aerts.Despite a more fragmented process, the band regards Set Yourself Free as more reminiscent of their early work, citing it as fresh and exciting. Ritter believes they have a fan favorite on their hands- something that will re-energize the old fan-base as well as draw in new listeners. Without a set sound in mind, the group was free to mold the record into what feels like an authentic Moon Taxi album.“We didn’t exactly sit down and have an agenda for what the album was going to sound like. We just worked on songs for a long period of time and then the last couple of months have been more of a discovery process – discovering what we’ve actually been doing and trying to make sense of the whole thing,” says Thomson. “So instead of going for some goal that we set out for, it was more just exploring things and seeing how they all work together. We just leave all our opinions in and that makes it more like a Moon Taxi record- it’s all our inside input rather than outside input.”The 13-song record covers a number of genres in a sequence that remains interesting listen after listen. The opening song, “Walk Out,” is a fully instrumental piece that features each member of the group. “It starts out with a really simple melody and just morphs into this thing we can all play on top of,” Bailey observes. “I think it’s what our fans want to hear – that aspect, the performance of it. You can hear our hands and fingers in a lot of these tracks that maybe got lost on some of the previous efforts. For me, that’s really exciting.Another band favorite is “Classics,” which was released as the first single from the record. The chorus line, “raise your glasses to the classics,” resonated quickly with the group as they recalled its debut at Hangout Fest when they used that line as a pre-performance toast. Driving and catchy, this song is an instant reminder of the songs we all live our lives to.An ode to Thomson’s hometown of Bowling Green, Kentucky, “Evergreen” brings a bluegrass vibe to the album and features Grammy winning artist Molly Tuttle. Thomson had been hoping to write “a little nugget” about his beloved town, but after Bowling Green was hit by a tornado in 2021, the right words finally came to him. With endearing harmonies and a folky melody, “Evergreen” will surely inspire many listeners to book tickets to visit home.With five previous albums under their belt, Moon Taxi had, and took, the opportunity to think outside the box and make some reaches, both musically and lyrically. “I think a lot of that freedom comes with having done it for a long time and on album number six, you’re no longer trying to find your sound like you are in earlier albums. You can kind of do what you want and then objectively look at it towards the end,” said Putnam. “You just trust yourself and your ear.”Set Yourself Free showcases the skill of a fully developed and practiced group of musicians. Free from the barriers of genre and self-definition, Moon Taxi presents a fresh and bold take on their sound.Learn more\",\n",

            "        \"description\": \"At this stage in the game, the name Whitechapel commands respect. Already sitting on one of the most enviable catalogs in contemporary metal, in 2019 they dropped The Valley, showcasing a confident evolution in their sound and standing as a true landmark release that sets a new standard for the genre. \\\"To me, it was like the stars aligning for us to create our almost perfect record in regard to songwriting, vocal performance, the mix and master, and the artwork,\\\" says guitarist Alex Wade. \\\"We like to look at our albums as chapters of our career, and that is one chapter I will never forget. I think it really solidified that we can embrace a new sound, and if we execute it properly, then the fanbase is going to support and enjoy it.\\\" In 2021, they return with that album's successor, the mighty Kin, which is an even more dynamic and diverse collection, further advancing the band's sound into new territory without losing sight of what brought them to this point. \\\"I feel with every album, we learn what worked best on the last one and try to utilize that in our writing. Early in the writing, there was some discussion of the album being like 'The Valley' part II, not literally called that, but in how the songs sound and flow through it. It's very much a storytelling type record like 'The Valley' was,\\\" adds vocalist Phil Bozeman, \\\"Musically, we just want to create what we vibe with at the given moment. We write music with how we feel and not what is expected of us, while lyrically the idea of continuing from the story of 'The Valley' was always the goal.\\\"The commencement of writing for the album was a direct result of the Covid pandemic, the band having several tours lined up to finish out the cycle for The Valley, but when these got cancelled, they decided to refocus their energies and begin working on a new record. \\\"We started writing sessions beginning in May and would write for usually a week solid, then take a few weeks off to let everyone digest that material, reset and gain new ideas and perspectives on the songs, then get back together for another week to continue the process,\\\" says Wade. Working for the first time with drummer Alex Rudinger, who has been touring with them since 2019, they treated writing like a job, working from 12pm to 7pm before taking a break, and if they found themselves grinding gears on a particular song, they would shift to working on another one, which helped refresh them. Wade also admits that following The Valley was initially a daunting task, something that he soon overcame. \\\"I can't speak for everyone in the band, but personally, I did feel slightly intimidated at first, wondering if we could summon that kind of magic again, but after hearing some of the demos we were working on, I felt more confident in being able to recreate a similar vibe to 'The Valley' on the new one. I feel like our songwriting is done in layers, and as each layer is created and placed into the songs, they begin to take on a life and personality of their own. So, with each layer, you get more confident in the songs and the impact that they are going to have.\\\" The result is a collection that explores a lot of sonic and emotional territory, and for the first time, it could be said that a Whitechapel record is as much a rock album as it is a metal one, an assertion Wade agrees with. \\\"It's still very much a metal album, I don't think you would hear any of the songs on mainstream radio, but there are elements of the record that have more of a rock and open vibe. We really wanted these songs to breathe and have life and to sound bigger than anything we've made so far. We have explored more singing on 'Kin' too. It wouldn't make sense to have the majority of the fanbase enjoy that sound and then shy away from it.\\\" This is not to say that the band have lost their hardest edges, with the full-on death metal assault that kicks off both \\\"Lost Boy\\\" and \\\"To The Wolves\\\" as brutal and serrated as extreme metal gets, and while Bozeman explores his wide-ranging singing voice more, he also cuts loose with his trademark roar across the album's eleven tracks.With Bozeman exploring childhood trauma on The Valley, it was their darkest release to-date, but its successor, which continues the story told on that record, is darker still. The album title pertains to relatives, which is what the album is about, but the deeper meaning behind this plays into the idea that the vocalist's alternate reality/persona is his kin as well. \\\"It's a fictional representation of a non-fictional story. I'm coming from a 'what if' standpoint. I'm also representing it in a way that conveys a more deep and dark frame of mind. This is all about what I could've been, had I decided to take the dark road. For the sake of storytelling, there are supernatural elements in play here as well,\\\" explains Bozeman. While each song is complex and would require going line by line to truly break down what they are actually about, Bozeman offers explanations of the first three. Opener \\\"I Will Find You\\\" takes place right after the last track off The Valley, \\\"Doom Woods\\\", which sees Bozeman entering into his life following the events characterized on that album. \\\"However, I am being followed by my alternate reality/evil self. It's the part of me that can't let go and will go to any heights to find the real me and pull me back into the dark past that I want to move on from.\\\" Then there is \\\"Lost Boy\\\", where the vocalist and his alternate self meet for the first time. \\\"He tries to convince me into going into his reality, which is a false sense of security. He knows I'm at a vulnerable point of my life, and this is a perfect time to pull me in. However, I resist and the alternate me is cast back into where he came from.\\\" This leads directly into \\\"A Bloodsoaked Symphony\\\", which sees his alternate self living through the tragedies of his life in a never-ending loop. Eventually the character kills himself only to find himself in the same world, but it's dark, depressing, and he's full of delusional thoughts. \\\"My parents are with him, but in a brain dead, corpse-like state, but his delusion sees it as a way to be together. Throughout the song, he relives certain parts of our past life but with different outcomes.\\\"These haunting lyrics and themes are accompanied by album art designed by Jillian Savage - as Wade explains, \\\"The artwork was a concept that was developed by Ben Savage and the band that was hand-painted by Ben's wife, Jillian Savage. Ben arranged a mock-up of what we were envisioning digitally, then they projected that image onto a canvas, and she painted the piece in a pointillism style - dot by dot - over the course of several weeks. The result produced the perfect vibe for the more artistic direction of the record. Not only was the music painstakingly labored over, but the art was too.\\\"Tracking of Kin was predominantly done at guitarist Zach Householder's home studio with producer Mark Lewis producing his fifth straight Whitechapel album, making for a very comfortable working environment. \\\"Creating records with him has an effortless flow to it, and we can track things pretty quickly and efficiently these days,\\\" says Wade. \\\"Mark has a great ear for giving us unique and complementary guitar and drum tones for the songs we are trying to record.\\\" Spending two weeks hunting for the right rhythm guitar tone before commencing, like writing, the band treat tracking like a job, putting in the hours between 12pm-8pm, Monday to Saturday, which is the most productive way of working. The tracks were then sent off to David Castillo at Ghostward Studios in Sweden in February 2021 for mixing, Ted Jensen mastering it in Nashville in March, making for a total of ten months spent on the record, the longest the band have worked on one to-date. Now, having another album they can be as proud of as its predecessor, it stands them in good stead as they look toward the future. \\\"I see more growth and a limitless potential,\\\" says Wade. \\\"I think we found a great formula on 'The Valley', and we used that to create another monumental record for our career that I can't wait for people to hear. We hope to continue to grow our fanbase with this new album, and always seek to move in a positive direction. I'm excited as the pandemic lessens for the touring world to come back to life and to be able to perform these massive songs we have created in the manner they were meant to be heard - live and loud.\\\"SanguisugaboggDeath Metal/Black MetalAbsurdist Ohio extreme metal band Sanguisugabogg ply an absolutely filthy, savagely downtuned brand of death metal with disgusting, gory but resolutely tongue-in-cheek lyrics.Formed in 2019 in Columbus, Ohio, the band initially comprised vocalist (and sometime-standup comedian) Devin Swank, guitarist Cameron Boggs, bassist Steph Barnes, and drummer Cody Davidson. Later, Boggs and Barnes were replaced by Cedrik Davis and Drew Arnold, respectively. Their unusual name comes from a combination of sanguisuga, the Latin word for leech, and the British slang word bog, meaning toilet -- with the aim of evoking a bloodsucking toilet. Songs with titles like \\\"Turkish Blood Orgy,\\\" \\\"Gored in the Chest,\\\" \\\"Urinary Ichor,\\\" \\\"Black Market Vasectomy,\\\" and \\\"Testicular Rot\\\" give a good idea of where they are coming from.The whole band had been fans of old-school death metal from an early age; Swank's first show, at age 12, was Cannibal Corpse. Inveterate jokers arguably as famous for their prodigious consumption of psychedelics as for their music -- they claimed to have recorded the entirety of both their albums while tripping on acid -- they dubbed themselves \\\"drug death metal.\\\" While the band's tone was goofy and jokey, they took their music very seriously, utilizing crushing drop-G tuning and eschewing solos for a relentless groove and piledriving riffs.Picked up by metal giant Century Media on the strength of their first demo EP, 2019's Pornographic Seizures, they recorded their first full-length album for the label, Tortured Whole, and released it in 2021. Following complaints over the EP's lyrics about violence against women, the band switched it around and made all the album's lyrics about violence against men. Their second album, Homicidal Ecstasy, followed in 2023.- From Allmusic.comPeelingFleshMetalSlamming Brutal Death act Peeling Flesh (US). Quitessence of slamming brutal death metal from members of Strangled, Aberrant Construct and Loathing Existence.LINE UP: Mychal Soto - Guitar; Jason Parrish - Guitar; Joe Pelletier - Drums; Austin Hirom - Bass; Damonteal Harris - Vocals.Gates to HellMetalForming in late 2019, Gates To Hell aimed to fuse the finest elements from both metal and hardcore, highlighting fast metal riffs with heavy hardcore and deathcore breakdowns written in a manner unexplored within the Kentucky music scene. The band released their first LP “Gates To Hell” in September of 2022, where they kept to their roots while developing a sound that was uniquely theirs.The response blew all expectations out of the water, with no sign of slowing down. Gates to Hell spent most of 2023 on the road playing nearly 150 shows in 11 different countries and Supported bands Dying Fetus, The Black Dahlia Murder, The Acacia Strain, Despised Icon, Sanguisugabogg, Bodysnatcher, 200 Stab Wounds, Kruelty, and Dying Wish on various tours across the US, Canada and Europe.Continuing this momentum with no sign of slowing down, the band is ushering in 2024 with a new home at Nuclear Blast Records, a pummeling new single, and heading on the road with labelmates Machine Head and Fear Factory.Learn more\",\n",
